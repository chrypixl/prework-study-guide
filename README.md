# My Prework Study Guide
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

This study guide was developed to help me familiarize myself with the tools and concepts needed to complete the bootcamp, and to be used as a resource for important notes I might need over the course of my study. Through development of this webpage I have learned some of the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, which are needed to understand the coursework of the coding bootcamp.

## Usage

To use this study guide, review the notes in each section. For a suggestion of what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools using Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (macOS). Choose the Console tab to see a list of topics that were covered in Prework as well as a suggestion of what to study first.

The Prework study guide is designed to be a resource for useful information that a student can refer to over the course of the bootcamp. Notes have been sorted and listed by subject, so we can quickly refer to the information that is needed. Each section contains a relevant topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If we open the DevTools console, we can see JavaScript running. It lists the topics covered in prework and will choose a topic for us to study first.
